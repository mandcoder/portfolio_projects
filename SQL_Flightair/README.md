## Data Source and Model Assumptions

The data model and all records used in this project are fully fictitious and were generated using Faker to simulate a realistic airline business scenario. No real customer, flight, or revenue data is included.

The synthetic data was adjusted where necessary to:
- enable meaningful age segmentation (Kids, Adults, Pensioners)
- reflect plausible business patterns
- support realistic, business-oriented SQL analysis

This project should therefore be viewed as a portfolio and learning project, with the primary focus on SQL methodology, data modeling, and business insight rather than real-world figures.
